# Greenhouse-Monitoring-System #
This was a group project for one of our courses at my University. thought i would post it here incase anyone would want to see or make use of it!

this will help you create a defined list of dcitionary of list of plants. set the the optimal temperature for those plants and the system will monitor the temperature and humidity pressure 
and various other factors that would be taken into consideration when dealing with a greenhouse monitoring system
